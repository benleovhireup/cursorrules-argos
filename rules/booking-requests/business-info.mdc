# Booking Requests - Business Information

## Overview

**Booking Requests** are requests for support worker services that clients or providers create. A booking request becomes a **booking** once a support worker accepts it. Booking requests allow clients/providers to specify:
- Location (home, community, remote, or combination)
- Date and time
- Support worker(s) to send the request to
- Description and requirements
- Vehicle requirements
- Support categories
- Repeat frequency (for recurring requests)

**Steps:**
1. Location step: `/booking-requests/create/provider/multiple-workers/location`
2. Details step: `/booking-requests/create/provider/multiple-workers/details`
3. Select Workers step: `/booking-requests/create/provider/multiple-workers/select-workers`

4. Details step: `/booking-requests/create/support-coordinator/details`
5. Select Workers step: `/booking-requests/create/support-coordinator/select-workers`

### Editing Booking Requests

#### flowV2 Edit Flow (Current)

**Base URL:** `/booking-requests/edit/{flowType}/{bookingRequestId}/`

**Attendant Care Client (flowV2):**
- `/booking-requests/edit/attendant-care/{bookingRequestId}/location`
- `/booking-requests/edit/attendant-care/{bookingRequestId}/date-and-time`
- `/booking-requests/edit/attendant-care/{bookingRequestId}/details`
- `/booking-requests/edit/attendant-care/{bookingRequestId}/select-workers`

**Provider (flowV2):**
- `/booking-requests/edit/provider/{bookingRequestId}/location`
- `/booking-requests/edit/provider/{bookingRequestId}/date-and-time`
- `/booking-requests/edit/provider/{bookingRequestId}/details`
- `/booking-requests/edit/provider/{bookingRequestId}/select-workers`

#### oneToMany Edit Flow (Deprecated)

**Base URL:** `/booking-requests/edit/{flowType}/multiple-workers/{bookingRequestId}/`

**Attendant Care Client (oneToMany):**
- `/booking-requests/edit/attendant-care/multiple-workers/{bookingRequestId}/location`
- `/booking-requests/edit/attendant-care/multiple-workers/{bookingRequestId}/details`
- `/booking-requests/edit/attendant-care/multiple-workers/{bookingRequestId}/select-workers`

**Provider (oneToMany):**
- `/booking-requests/edit/provider/multiple-workers/{bookingRequestId}/location`
- `/booking-requests/edit/provider/multiple-workers/{bookingRequestId}/details`
- `/booking-requests/edit/provider/multiple-workers/{bookingRequestId}/select-workers`

**Note:** Users can only edit booking requests they created. Editing redirects to the first incomplete step if previous steps weren't completed. The flow version (V2 vs oneToMany) is determined by how the booking request was originally created.

### Duplicating Booking Requests

**Base URL:** `/booking-requests/duplicate/{flowType}/{bookingRequestId}/`

Same step structure as edit flow:
- `/booking-requests/duplicate/attendant-care/{bookingRequestId}/location`
- `/booking-requests/duplicate/provider/{bookingRequestId}/location`
- etc.

**Note:** Duplicating creates a new booking request with the same details, allowing users to quickly create similar requests.

### Viewing Booking Request Details

**Client View:**
- `/booking-requests/client/{bookingRequestId}`
- Shows: booking details, support workers, status, action buttons (edit, duplicate, cancel)
- Shows `EditBookingRequestNotice` if all workers have declined

**Support Worker View:**
- `/booking-requests/support-worker/{bookingRequestId}`
- Shows: booking details, client information, accept/decline buttons
- Shows `BookingRequestDetailsNotice` for various states (compliance, availability, etc.)

**Provider View:**
- `/booking-requests/{bookingRequestId}`
- Shows: booking details, support workers, status

### Retrospective Booking Creation

**Attendant Care Client:**
- `/booking-requests/create/retrospective/attendant-care/details`
- Used for creating bookings that already happened (backdating)

**Provider:**
- `/booking-requests/create/retrospective/provider/details`
- Used for creating bookings that already happened (backdating)

## Business Workflows

### Creating a New Booking Request (flowV2)

1. **User navigates to create flow** (location step)
2. **Location Step:** User selects location type (home, community, remote, combination) and enters address
3. **Date and Time Step:** User selects date, start time, end time, and optionally repeat frequency with end date
4. **Details Step:** User enters description, vehicle requirements, support categories
5. **Select Workers Step:** User selects one or more support workers (or skipped if direct request)
6. **Submit:** Booking request is created and sent to selected workers

### Creating a New Booking Request (oneToMany - Deprecated)

1. **User navigates to create flow** (location step)
2. **Location Step:** User selects location type (home, community, remote, combination) and enters address
3. **Details Step:** User enters date, start time, end time, description, vehicle requirements, support categories (date/time combined with details)
4. **Select Workers Step:** User selects one or more support workers
5. **Submit:** Booking request is created and sent to selected workers

**Key Difference:** oneToMany flow combines date/time entry with the details step, while flowV2 has a separate date-and-time step and supports repeat frequency.

### Editing a Booking Request

1. **User navigates to booking request details**
2. **Clicks "Edit" button**
3. **Redirected to first step** (location) - can only edit if previous steps completed
4. **User modifies information** across steps
5. **Submit:** Booking request is updated

**Important:** If a user tries to access a later step without completing previous steps, they are redirected to the first incomplete step.

### Duplicating a Booking Request

1. **User navigates to booking request details**
2. **Clicks "Duplicate" button**
3. **Redirected to create flow** with pre-filled information from original request
4. **User can modify** any details before submitting
5. **Submit:** New booking request is created

### Support Worker Accepting/Declining

1. **Support worker receives booking request** (via notification or viewing their requests)
2. **Views booking request details** (`/booking-requests/support-worker/{id}`)
3. **Sees notices** if there are compliance requirements or availability issues
4. **Clicks "Accept" or "Decline"**
5. **If accepted:** Booking request becomes a booking
6. **If all workers decline:** Client sees `EditBookingRequestNotice` suggesting to edit or post job

## Key Components

### BookingRequestDetailsNotice
- **Used by:** Support workers (primary), clients, providers
- **Purpose:** Displays notices/alerts on booking request details pages
- **Features:** Responsive action buttons (full width on mobile, auto width on desktop 960px+)
- **Location:** `web-apps/src/booking-requests/components/BookingRequestDetailsNotice/`

### EditBookingRequestNotice
- **Used by:** Clients
- **Purpose:** Shown when all support workers have declined a booking request
- **Features:** Yellow warning stripe, "Edit" and "Post Job" buttons
- **Location:** `web-apps/src/booking-requests/components/EditBookingRequestNotice/`

### StepLayout
- **Used by:** All create/edit/duplicate flows
- **Purpose:** Provides consistent layout for multi-step forms
- **Features:** Back button with hover/focus states, sidebar, footer
- **Location:** `web-apps/src/booking-requests/components/StepLayout/`

## Flow Types

- **ATTENDANT_CARE_CLIENT:** `attendant-care-client`
- **PROVIDER:** `provider`
- **SUPPORT_COORDINATOR:** `support-coordinator`

## Request Types

- **Direct Request:** Sent to a single pre-selected support worker (uses `?supportWorkerId={id}` query param)
- **Team Request:** Sent to multiple support workers (user selects workers in select-workers step)

## Important Notes

1. **Route Guards:** All booking request routes require authentication and appropriate user type guards
2. **Step Completion:** Users cannot skip steps - must complete in order (location → date-and-time → details → select-workers)
3. **Feature Flags:** Some flows are controlled by feature flags (e.g., `newBookingRequestFlowForAttendantCareClient`)
4. **Retrospective Bookings:** Simplified flow (starts at details step) for creating past bookings
5. **Booking vs Booking Request:** A booking request becomes a booking once accepted by a support worker

## Testing Access

To test booking request flows, you need:
- Valid user credentials for the appropriate user type
- Booking request IDs (for viewing/editing/duplicating)
- Support worker IDs (for direct requests)

**Example Test URLs:**
- Create: `http://app.local.hireup.com.au/booking-requests/create/attendant-care/location`
- View: `http://app.local.hireup.com.au/booking-requests/client/{bookingRequestId}`
- Edit: `http://app.local.hireup.com.au/booking-requests/edit/attendant-care/{bookingRequestId}/location`
